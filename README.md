# weaver

## Description
- Weaver is an image editor web application where users can sign up and weave images together. 
- Weaving images creates a woven or loom effect on the final merged image.
- The images can be saved to the user's profile and shared on social media.

## MVP - minimum viable product
- A git repository (or repositories) hosted on Github, 
- Use of new technology AWS, Docker, Django,

## Stretch Goals
- Extra weave patterns
- Export image in different formats
- Use of The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City API for random examples

## Future Work
- Using social meida API to post the weaved image to a user social meida account 
- Build a canvas library for weaving images and port as a npm package
- Intorduce scalling with Kubernetes
- Security revision for production
- User validation
- Use of The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City API

## Install
- To install this project you must setup enviroment vriables for a database and S3 bucket on the django api side  
- create and auth0 account
- use the docker files to build images and deoploy

## Features 

## Built With
- AWS EC2 Linux 
- AWS S3 Bucket
- AWS RDMS Postgres
- AWS Command Line Interface
- Docker Compose & Docker Engine
- Django with Django REST framework 
- React for Frontend
- auth0 for user authentication
- CSS: React-Bootstrap


## Code organization
The project trys to follow the coding style guide provied by [AirBnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Design pattern and System design approach

- Architecture diagram
- http://williamleacy.dev/profile/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-13-at-3.16.20-AM.png

- The goal of this project was to learn about deoplying and scalling a project. I decided to try out Amazon Web Services 
and sign up for a Free teir access. 
### Basic Setup
- I Started up a EC2 instance, S3 bucket and a RDMS with Postgress.
- Used the AWS Command Line Interface to install teh docker engine and docker compsose to the EC2 instance
- Locally I install docker engine and setup boiler plate React frontend container and Django API container
- Setup auth0 by intergrating the The boilier plate source code for react project and django project
### Authentication
- The authentication design pattern choosen for this project is authentication through the client side with the react frontend
- container. It autheticates with my admin account on auth0 servers and then send back a json web token. This token can then
- be in REST routes when commincating with the django api. Django is setup to jsut secure its end points. It doesnt store users,
- It checks from auth0 if the user was authenticated with the react frontend
### Weaving Images with canvas
- The design solution for weaving images with canvas is to create a template array that represents grid with x and y coordinates
- A size for a square is decided based off the amount of divsion of the image horizontal and vertical weaved strips
- Two images are uploaded by the user nad a forloop chooses between which image to render to the new canvas based of contional that 
- minics a weave pattern once fully drawed to the canvas
- Uploading the weaved image to AWS S3 and AWS RDMS
- To convert a canvas element into a image file a converting porcess is needed to be followed
- The conversion proccess works by :
- 1 convert the canvas element to a data url
- 2 convert the data url to a blob
- 3 convert the blob to a image file type

    // this fetch retunr a data url in memory which can be converted to a blod

    Title: Converting a base64 string to a blob in JavaScript
    Type: (raw)
    publisher: (https://ionicframework.com/blog/converting-a-base64-string-to-a-blob-in-javascript/)
    */

    // Uploading, a rendered canvas to a server, involves several steps
    // Ultimately, the canvas element needs to be a File Object before uploading.
    // To convert a canvas to a file object that is an image, we first need to 
    // convert the canvas element to a base64 string which is a data URL representation 
    // of the canvas element. For the base64 string to become a Blob object, it needs to be decoded and converted 
    // to a URL object. To achieve this  "fake" URL request to the base65 string will auto return it as an URL object.
    // This URL object can then be converted to blob with the .blob() method
    // This blob can then be converted to a file with the new File class
